Bitcoin is a powerful new peer-to-peer platform for the next generation of financial technology. The decentralized nature of the Bitcoin network allows for a highly resilient value transfer infrastructure, and this allows merchants to gain greater profits.

This is because there are little to no fees for transferring Bitcoins from one person to another. Unlike other payment methods, Bitcoin payments cannot be reversed, so once you are paid you can ship! No waiting days for a payment to clear.
